    <p>Are you on the hunt to find the best chili recipe on the internet? Well, stop right
     there, because you just did! If you're looking for hearty, filling chili that's just
     the right level of spicy, this is the chili recipe for you.</p>
    <p>Yes, this recipe does look like you throw everything but the kitchen sink in it,
     but wow is the long ingredient list worth it. You might as well just make a double
     batch because you'll be craving more as soon as it's gone.</p>

     <h2>How to Make Chili</h2>
     <p>You'll find the full, detailed recipe below, but here's what you can expect when
     making this chili:</p>
    <strong>Sauté the Vegetables</strong>
     <p>In a large pot, sauté the onion, bell pepper, Anaheim pepper, jalapeños, and garlic
     until softened.</p>
    <strong>Brown the Ground Beef</strong>
     <p>Brown the ground beef, then season it with Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder,
     bouillon, and beer. Once combined, add the beef mixture to the vegetable mixture.</p>
    <strong>Add the Tomato Products and Seasonings</strong>
     <p>Stir crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, wine, and seasonings into the
     beef and vegetable mixture.</p>
     <strong>Simmer</strong>
     <p>Bring the mixture to a boil, then simmer until the flavors have blended together,
     about 90 minutes. Add in kidney beans, then simmer for another 30 minutes, until the
     beans are hot.</p>
    <strong>Make the Crema</strong>
     <p>In a blender, combine sour cream, cilantro, and cumin to create a crema. Serve the
     chili topped with crema and any other toppings you like.</p>

     <h2>How to Thicken Chili</h2>
     <p>This chili should already be your preferred level of thickness, thanks to all the
     thickening agents in it. But if you're having trouble reaching your desired consistency,
     there are multiple ways to thicken chili.</p>
     <p>The easiest way is to simply simmer it for longer. The longer it simmers, the more
     liquid will evaporate.</p>
     <p>But, if you don't have time to simmer your chili for hours, you can thicken it with
     cornmeal, cornstarch, or all-purpose flour. Add 1 tablespoon of cornmeal directly to the
     pot and allow it to simmer for about 10 more minutes to thicken up. Or add a cornstarch
     or flour slurry — this means 1 tablespoon of water mixed with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch
     or 2 tablespoons of water mixed with 1 tablespoon of flour. If you add flour or 
     cornstarch directly to the chili, it will clump. Instead, gradually whisk in the slurry
     then simmer for 10 minutes. </p>
     <p>Another option is to add more starchy ingredients, like vegetables or beans.
     These will absorb some of the liquids and thicken the chili. Plus, you'll have more
     hearty and delicious ingredients to enjoy.</p>

     <h2>What to Serve With Chili</h2>
     <p>Chili is filling enough to stand-alone as a full meal itself, but you can always add
     sides or even use chili as a "topping" for other foods.</p>
     <p>Try serving it with cornbread, coleslaw, or grilled corn. For more inspiration check
     out our best side dishes to serve with chili.</p>
     <p>We love to use chili as a topping over rice, baked potatoes, nachos, and even as a
     filling for tacos. Let your heart (and stomach) decide how you want to enjoy your chili
     because the possibilities are endless.</p>

     <h2>What to Serve With Chili</h2>
     <p>Package completely-cooled chili into an airtight container and store it in the
     refrigerator for up to four days.</p>

     <h2>What to Serve With Chili</h2>
     <p>If you want your chili to last longer, you should freeze it. Ladle completely cooled
     individual servings of chili into zip-top freezer bags (make sure to squeeze out the
     excess air). Label and date the bags, and store them in the freezer for up to three
     months.</p>
     <p>When you're ready to eat it, thaw it overnight in the fridge and reheat on the stove
     or in the microwave.</p>
